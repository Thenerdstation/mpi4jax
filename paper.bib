Its code structure is optimized to exploit available Python utilities, remove simulation bottlenecks, and comply with modern best practices. Furthermore, support for Bohrium is added, a framework that provides a just-in-time compiler for array operations and that supports parallel execution on both CPU and GPU targets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}For applications containing more than a million grid elements, such as a typical {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M1" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mn mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}1{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}∘{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}×{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mn mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}1{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}∘{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/msup{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}{\textless}span{\textgreater}{\textless}svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="34pt" height="11pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="cb533c0820352f32a7ca953bf25ffe4a"{\textgreater}{\textless}svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="gmd-11-3299-2018-ie00001.svg" width="34pt" height="11pt" src="gmd-11-3299-2018-ie00001.png"/{\textgreater}{\textless}/svg:svg{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} horizontal resolution global ocean model, Veros is approximately half as fast as the MPI-parallelized Fortran base code on 24 CPUs and as fast as the Fortran reference when running on a high-end GPU.

  abstract   = {We introduce NetKet, a comprehensive open source framework for the study of many-body quantum systems using machine learning techniques. The framework is built around a general and flexible implementation of neural-network quantum states, which are used as a variational ansatz for quantum wavefunctions. NetKet provides algorithms for several key tasks in quantum many-body physics and quantum technology, namely quantum state tomography, supervised learning from wavefunction data, and ground state searches for a wide range of customizable lattice models. Our aim is to provide a common platform for open research and to stimulate the collaborative development of computational methods at the interface of machine learning and many-body physics.},
